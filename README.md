# Professional Wrestling Round Robin Tournament Picker

A number of internet communities that I'm a part of have pick 'em contest for the G1 wrestling tournament in Japan. Because the format of the tournament is based on round robin play within pools, there are not good web tools to build or manage such a contest. As a result the hosts are often left scheduling out the entire tournament as a Google Form and then manually tracking user scores in Sheets.

I wanted to create a system that would allow for easily creating the pick 'em form and tracking the results. If the pick 'ems were easier to organize, I believe that there may be increased interest in doing something similar for other Japanese wrestling round robin tournaments.

This is the front end for the potential application.
